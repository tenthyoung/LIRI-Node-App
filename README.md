# LIRI-Node-App
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

Things still left to do:
Make sure your .env has the api keys

And then follow "What each command should do downward?"
