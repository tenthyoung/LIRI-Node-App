# LIRI-Node-App
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

Things still left to do:
Make sure your .env has the api keys

And then follow "What each command should do downward?"

It's on Netflix!

You'll use the axios package to retrieve data from the OMDB API. Like all of the in-class activities, the OMDB API requires an API key. You may use trilogy

4. node liri.js do-what-it-says
Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in random.txt.
Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.


BONUS
In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called log.txt.
Make sure you append each command you run to the log.txt file. 
Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.
